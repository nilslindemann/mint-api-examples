# Mint API Examples

(Work in progress)

These are (unofficial) examples for the [Mint Language](https://mint-lang.com/). The goals are:

* Learn Mint by typing it,
* find and fix possible bugs in the [API](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/tree/master/core/source) on the way,
* make this a useful reference for other Mint newbies,
* cover the whole API.

I check the code against [the latest compiler](https://mint-lang.com/install), and I use the latest language features.

This folder is a [mint project](https://mint-lang.com/guide/getting-started/using-the-cli). Run `mint start` inside and then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser.
