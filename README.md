# Mint API Examples

This is my personal project to learn more about the [Mint programming language](https://mint-lang.com/). WORK IN PROGRESS (very much at the beginning).

The goal is to go through the whole [Mint API](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/tree/master/core/source) and add an example every day. I start at the bottom (currently `Window.mint`) and work my way up. I check the code against the latest compiler and I use the latest language features. See [Install Mint from source](https://mint-lang.com/install).

This folder is a mint project without dependencies, just run `mint start` inside and then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ .

I am open to contributions. I suggest you start at the top or in the middle of the API, because I am not there yet XD.
