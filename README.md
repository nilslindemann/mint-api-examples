# Mint API Examples

WORK IN PROGRESS.

These are (unofficial) examples for the [API](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/tree/master/core/source) of [Mint](https://mint-lang.com/). The goal is to cover the whole API.

I check the code against the latest compiler and use the latest language features. See [Install Mint from source](https://mint-lang.com/install).

This folder is a mint project. Run `mint start` inside and then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser.

Contributions are welcome.
